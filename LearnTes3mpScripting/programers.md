lua is pretty easy but used in many places
there is a LUA IDE but you can just use Notepad of your choice


go into mp-stuff/scripts/ folder of your tes3mp install
serverCore.lua got all the events triggered
eventHandler.lua well handles the events further
logicHandler.lua is for the logic behind.

if you got questions join the discords scripting_help and
maybe ping the developer david c
